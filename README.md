# Project Estimation Timeline App

A bilingual (ID/EN) project estimation and scheduling app for Indonesian project managers, featuring accurate timelines, overtime projections, compliance with Indonesian labor regulations, and clear stakeholder communication.

## Vision Statement

A bilingual (ID/EN) project estimation and scheduling app that converts man-hour inputs, role dependencies, and working-hour rules into accurate timelines, overtime (lembur) projections, and compensationâ€”so project managers can hit deadlines confidently, stay compliant with Indonesian labor regulations, and communicate plans clearly to stakeholders.

## Key Goals

- **Fast, Accurate Estimation**: Enable quick "what-if" estimation with finish-by-date vs. normal-hours finish-date scenarios
- **Automated Scheduling**: Generate schedules with role dependencies and individual capacity limits
- **Indonesian Labor Compliance**: Calculate overtime (lembur) hours and compensation per Indonesian regulations
- **Localized Communication**: Provide clear, bilingual (ID/EN) outputs including Gantt charts, cost breakdowns, and exportable reports
- **Error Reduction**: Minimize planning errors via constraints, validations, and contextual error messages
- **Enterprise Ready**: Ensure data privacy, security, and auditability for enterprise use
